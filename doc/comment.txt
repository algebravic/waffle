From Ulam’s Wikipedia entry: Earlier, while playing solitaire during
his recovery from surgery, Ulam had thought about playing hundreds of
games to estimate statistically the probability of a successful
outcome.[38] With ENIAC in mind, he realized that the availability of
computers made such statistical methods very practical. John von
Neumann immediately saw the significance of this insight. In March
1947 he proposed a statistical approach to the problem of neutron
diffusion in fissionable material.[39] Because Ulam had often
mentioned his uncle, Michał Ulam, "who just had to go to Monte Carlo"
to gamble, Metropolis dubbed the statistical approach "The Monte Carlo
method".[37] Metropolis and Ulam published the first unclassified
paper on the Monte Carlo method in 1949.[40]
